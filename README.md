# BversityProject
This is the project that I completed under the Mega Bioinformatics '23 online internship that was hosted by Bversity. It was a 10 day course that covered a wide plethora of topics like gene annotation, gene expresson annotation, molecular docking, heat map generation, homology modelling and many more.
